### Problem3

``` r
#??? hwo do you know units of the variables???

library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

The NY_NOAA dataset was driven from NOAA National Climatic Data Center.
It contains information from all New York state weather stations from
January 1, 1981 through December 31, 2010. The NOAA dataset contains
2595176 rows and 7 columns.

The variables in the data set are:

-   `id`: Weather station ID
-   `date`: Date of observation
-   `prcp`: Precipitation (tenths of mm)
-   `snow`: Snowfall (mm)
-   `snwd`: Snow depth (mm)
-   `tmax`: Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
-   `tmin`: Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)

There are 747 distinct weather stations in NYS.

Because not all weather stations in NY collect all these variables, the
original dataset contains extensive amount of missing data.

To take a closer look at the amount of missing data, let’s look at what
proportion of data is missing for each variable.

``` r
noaa_missing = ny_noaa |> 
  summarize(
    missing_prcp = mean(is.na(prcp)),
    missing_snow = mean(is.na(snow)),
    missing_snwd = mean(is.na(snwd)),
    missing_tmax = mean(is.na(tmax)),
    missing_tmin = mean(is.na(tmin))
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

-   Data shows that there nearly 50% of data is missing in `tmax` and
    `tmin`. 43 % for each of these variables have missing data.

``` r
noaa_tidy = ny_noaa %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(
    prcp = prcp / 10 ,
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax) / 10,
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin) / 10,
    year = as.numeric(year),
    day = as.numeric(day), 
    month = recode_factor(month,
          "01" = "January",
          "02" = "February",
          "03" = "March",
          "04" = "April",
          "05" = "May",
          "06" = "June",
          "07" = "July",
          "08" = "August",
          "09" = "September",
          "10" = "October",
          "11" = "November",
          "12" = "December"
          )) %>% 
  relocate(year, month, day, everything())
```

``` r
noaa_tidy |>  
  count(snow) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 282 × 2
    ##     snow       n

-   For snowfall, the most commonly observed value is ‘0’, indicating
    that the most days in NY is not snowy.
